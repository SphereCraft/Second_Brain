# Why my current profession is useful

Attention to detail (maps, cargo), problem-solving (route changing, equipment breakdown), time management (planning and time estimates), adaptability (regulations, change in priority), logistics (inventory, scheduling) are some I can think of off the top of my head that will be helpful. The skills don't have to be technology driven. üëç
