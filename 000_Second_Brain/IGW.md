IGW - Internet Gateway

An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available [[VPC]] component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] traffic. It does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.
