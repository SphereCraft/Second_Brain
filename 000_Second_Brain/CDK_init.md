# CDK init

We will create a [[New CDK Project]] to get used to doing this, So in a new folder of your choice, create a new folder called vpc-cdk-project - then cd into it.
Initialise the [[CDK]] with [[Typescript]] language.
	cdk init app --language typescript

To update
	sudo npm install -g aws-cdk
Go into the lib folder and open up the vpc-cdk file 
Delete bottom comments
Should have imports and export class generated for us.
Delete 3rd line in imports and add the import for [[EC2]] config
