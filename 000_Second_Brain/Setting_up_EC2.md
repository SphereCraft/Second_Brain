# Setting up EC2

This is just a basic set up and one that will be expanded upon in time

	1. Log into you IAM AWS Account
	2. Select the region you are closest to
	3. Make sure you have the shortcuts you need regulary set up, like EC2, VPC, IAM, Lambda, S3, RDS
	4. Goto EC2 Dashboard
	5. Select Amazon Linux
	6. Select instance type t.2 Micro (this is for training as its the free version, may need a different one when setting up a clients account)
	7. Launch instance

Again this is a basic set up and one that will get more complex as training goes.

Next [[Connect to EC2]] instance
