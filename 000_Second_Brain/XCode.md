# XCode Command Line Tools 

IMPORTANT: we only require the _command line tools_ part of XCode — not the full development suite (which is a considerably large download). You are welcome to install all of XCode if you have the time and bandwidth — but it's not necessary, nor will we mention it again in this guide.

There are a few ways to install XCode Command Line Tools:

****Route 1:**** `**Run xcode-select --install**`

Copy and paste this into your terminal:

xcode-select --install
