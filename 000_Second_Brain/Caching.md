# Caching

Caching is a technique that will temperately stores data in an area to enable faster data retrieval instead of having to go to the primary storage location. Great for data that is used often. Which can make the system more efficient and help to improve the performance of the operation saving on both time and resources.
**3 Key reasons**
- Performance - Quicker response time and lower latency, helping application run smoother and without delay, keeping users happier
- Scalability - more users, more cache can scale providing help with performance standards keeping the user happy
- Cost - using cache's will use less computational power resulting in a lower cost (lower compute usage). The use of good cache can lead to large financial savings.
**Main types of caching**
- [[Browser Cache]]
- [[Content Delivery Networks Cache]]
- [[In-Memory cache]]
- [[Database Cache]]
- [[Application Cache]]
Understanding caching as a cloud engineer/architect is crucial as it can 
**optimise resource usage**
**help reduce costs**
**improve overall performance**
