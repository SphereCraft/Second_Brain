# Curl Request - Project

run curl [https://example.com](https://example.com/)

saving the output

curl [https://example.com](https://example.com/) -o example.com

Analyzing HTTP response headers

run curl -I [https://example.com](https://example.com/) to fethc the HTTP headers of the response

  

****200 OK:****

- ****Meaning****: The request was successful, and the [[server]] has returned the requested resource.
    
- ****Importance****: This is the most common code that indicates a successful HTTP request. Verifying that interactions between the client and [[server]] are working correctly is crucial.
    

****404 Not Found:****

- ****Meaning****: The [[server]] cannot find the requested resource. This code is often seen when a URL does not exist on the [[server]].
    
- ****Importance****: Identifying broken links or incorrect URL references in your application helps maintain a good user experience and SEO ranking.
    

****301 Moved Permanently:****

- ****Meaning****: This response code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, which is provided by the Location header.
    
- ****Importance****: This is critical for website maintenance and SEO. It ensures that users and search engines are directed to the correct URL, preserving the site's link equity.
    

  
A. Using `traceroute` or `tracert`

1. ****Open Terminal or Command Prompt:****
    
    - Linux/mac-OS: Open Terminal.
        
    - Windows: Open Command Prompt (cmd).
        
2. ****Run the Command:****
    
    - ****Linux/mac-OS:**** Type `traceroute google.com` and press `Enter`.
        
    - ****Windows:**** Type `tracert google.com` and press `Enter`.

### B. Analysing the Output

The output will display a list of 'hops'. Each hop represents a router or gateway that packets pass through on their way to the destination. For each hop, you'll typically see:

- The hop's number in the sequence.
    
- The IP address of the hop.
    
- The round-trip time (RTT) for packets to reach that hop and return to your computer. This is usually shown in milliseconds (ms) and may be displayed three times for accuracy.

#### What This Exercise Teaches you

- ****Internet Routing Complexity:**** Demonstrates the multiple intermediate steps a packet takes through different networks to reach its destination.
    
- ****Network Performance:**** The RTT times can give you an idea of the latency between your computer and each hop along the path.
    
- ****Troubleshooting:**** Identifying where packets are getting delayed or lost can help diagnose network connectivity issues.
