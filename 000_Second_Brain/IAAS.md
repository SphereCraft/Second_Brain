# IAAS

**Infrastructure as a service** (**IaaS**) is a [[cloud computing]] service model by means of which computing resources are supplied by a cloud services provider. The IaaS vendor provides the storage, network, servers, and virtualisation (which mostly refers, in this case, to emulating computer hardware). This service enables users to free themselves from maintaining an on-premises data centre.

##### Example 
Amazon [[EC2]]
