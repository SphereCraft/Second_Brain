# JavaScript While Loops

// -----While Loops-----

let instanceCount = 0;
const targetCount = 5;

while (instanceCount < targetCount) {
    console.log ("Launching EC2 Instance # " + (instanceCount + 1));
    instanceCount++;
}

while loops are used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Useful in cloud engineering for tasks that need to continue until a state has been reached
We have 2 variables one is a [[const]]. The const is the target that will end the condition.
