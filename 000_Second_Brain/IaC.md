# IaC

Infrastructure as Code (IaC), will enable teams to manage their infrastructure like they do with their apps, this means the can use
	[[Version Control]]
	[[Collaboration]]
	and streamline their operations and efficiency.
By using IaC teams can reduce manual errors and increase productivity.
A leading tool for IaC is [[AWS CloudFormation]].
The alternative to IaC is Infrastructure in the console AKA ClickOps, this is what we've been doing so far, meaning working in the [[AWS]] dashboard, but we want to build everything in code.
IaC is the modern approach to provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure, it involves automating the deployment of infrastructure, this will allow for 
	faster setup
	consistent environments
	and a seamless integration with [[DevOps]]
