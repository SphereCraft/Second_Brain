# AWS CloudFormation

This is the native solution for defining and deploying resources in [[AWS]] environments.
AWS CloudFormation is an example of [[IaC]] in action, it provides a way to define and provision [[AWS]] resources with code.
With [[AWS]] CloudFormation we can define the whole of [[AWS]] in code form, stored in simple text files.
This code specifies what resources are needed, how they should be configured and how they relate to one another.
Once done [[AWS]] CloudFormation handles things automatically ensuring everything is done together, this will help minimise potential errors and manual processes.

***Benefits of using [[IaC]] with CloudFormation***
Automation and speed
	CloudFormation allows for automatic deployment and configuration of resources, reducing manual effort and speeding up the provisioning process.
Consistency and standardisation
	CloudFormation helps with consistency ensuring less discrepancies with environments and meeting compliance and security standards.
Collaboration and  [[Version Control]]
	this allows teams to work together and easier to track changes
Efficient Management
	CloudFormations can make templates to help with consistant reproduction of code.
CloudFormation template is a simple text file in either
	[[JSON]]
	or [[YAML]]
