# AWS CloudFormation

This is the native solution for defining and deploying resources in [AWS](~/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/AWS.md) environments.
AWS CloudFormation is an example of [IaC](./IaC.md) in action, it provides a way to define and provision [AWS](~/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/AWS.md)
resources with code. With [AWS](~/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/AWS.md) CloudFormation we can define the whole of 
[AWS](~/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/AWS.md) in code form, stored in simple text files. This code specifies what resources are needed,
how they should be configured and how they relate to one another. Once done [AWS](~/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/AWS.md)
CloudFormation handles things automatically ensuring everything is done together, this will help minimise potential errors and manual processes.

***Benefits of using [IaC](~/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/IaC.md) with CloudFormation***
Automation and speed
	CloudFormation allows for automatic deployment and configuration of resources, reducing manual effort and speeding up the provisioning process.
Consistency and standardisation~
	CloudFormation helps with consistency ensuring less discrepancies with environments and meeting compliance and security standards.
Collaboration and  [Version Control(./Version_Control.md)]
	this allows teams to work together and easier to track changes
Efficient Management
	CloudFormations can make templates to help with consistent reproduction of code.
CloudFormation template is a simple text file in either
	[JSON]
	or [YAML]
