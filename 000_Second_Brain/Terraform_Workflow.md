# Terraform Workflow

A good form of workflow is

	1. Define - where we define the infrastructure with all required blocks
	2. init - initialise phase in the working directory, gets things ready to apply
	3. Plan - review the execution plan to see what changes will be made
	4. apply - Apply/modify the planned changes
	5. Validate - inspect the state of the infrastructure
