# Network Virtualisation

Combining software and hardware network resources into a single software interface network known as a virtual network. This can aid in being able to change and adjust softwares from one point. Managing virtual switches is easier that physical swithes in a physical [[server]] network, so scaling is simplified. Ideal for rapidly changing network demands and enviroments. More efficient and flexability. It abstracts the complexity of physical networks and allowing of simpler and centralised management of network functionalities.
