Quick story of Devops
The history before devops
Dev - Developers
Ops - Operations
These 2 teams almost worked against each other. 1 team controlled the coding then on to the testing, then on to the operations, Almost throwing it over a virtual wall and forgetting it. Each operation could take months and if code had issues it would go back and the whole process took so long. This could take months before any update could be deployed. Slower update times, slower deployment, just slower in every way. Step in Devops, bridging the gap between the two. Encouraging everyone to work together, being more open. Its more of a culture that a job. This will make developing in smaller chunks making things faster and more up to date. This is a very brief description, can watch more to get more detail, but basically it took teams from secrecy to working together.
