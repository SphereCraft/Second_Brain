# EFS

Is an Amazon cloud based simple, scalable and fully managed [[NFS]] file system for use in the cloud or on-premises Linux based business applications.
Its scalability can go as high as [[petabytes]] without impacting other services or applications. I will scale up or down automatically depending what you are doing, ie adding or removing data/files.
It is designed to handle thousands of [[EC2]] instances so it can handle high levels of throughput with out any lag.
