# CIDR Blocks

These refer to the [[IP Address]] range assigned to the [[VPC]]. When creating [[VPC]]'s you specify the [[IP Address]] using CIDR Notation.
Simply a CIDR block outlines the property lines within the [[VPC]] determining your [[IP Address]] range and how many resources can be on it.
ie. if the CIDR Block [[IP Address]] range starts 192.168.1.0 and ends 192.168.1.255 then you would have 255 [[IP Address]]'s. 
Everything (services) you use within this [[VPC]] must have an [[IP Address]] within the range to insure correct network communications and ID. Making sure this is done will help manage the infrastructure to be scaleable and manageable.
