# AWS CloudFormation Documentations

docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformations

this is the place to find any answers for all resource types.

API reference - this will show all the operations we can run with CloudFormation

Each type will have a page showing what properties that can be used. Remember we use yaml right now. Some are required properties and some are not.

List of all service is in the AWS CloudFormation/user guide then template reference - resource and property reference
[aws-template-resource-type-ref](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)
