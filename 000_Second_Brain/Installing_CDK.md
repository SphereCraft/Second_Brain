# Installing CDK

In terminal

npm install -g typescript - this will globally install typescript on your system

tsc --version - this will check 

npm install -g aws-cdk - this globally installs [[CDK]] to your system

cdk --version - checks

For linux user might need to add sudo to the start of commands

Now need to create a [[CDK]] project.
create a main folder for the project
To install a new project, navigate to new folder
	cdk init app --language typescript - this will set [[Typescript]] as the language for the project.
This could take a while to set up, depending of internet speed, pc speed etc.
When done, should see some more folders and files. In bin will be the cdk.ts file and in the lib folder, should see the cdk stack file. these are the most important folders that we will use.
