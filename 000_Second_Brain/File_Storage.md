# File Storage

File storage will organise all the data like in your computer. organising the data into a file based system. Best used when applications require a shared file system, for user directories or home directories or for storing file and folders in a structured hierarchy. 

**Advantages** This is great as most people have seen this kind of system before (eg windows and home computer storage). This system will also support Open, Close, Read, Write and navigation.

**Disadvantages** not as scalable as object storage and the performance can degrade with high numbers of files and users that are accessing things at the same time

An example of file storage in [[AWS]] is Amazon [[EFS]] or elastic file system
