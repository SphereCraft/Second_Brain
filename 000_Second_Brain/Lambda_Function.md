# Lambda Function

**What is AWS Lambda**

**✔** Run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing run-times.   

**✔** Run code for virtually any type of application or back-end service. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic.  

**✔** Write Lambda functions in your favourite language (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more) and use both server-less and container tools, such as AWS SAM or Docker CLI, to build, test, and deploy your functions.
