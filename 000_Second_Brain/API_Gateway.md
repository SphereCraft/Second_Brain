# API Gateway

API Gateway is a single point of entry for all incoming API calls (requests) from the client (user) to the back-end services.
API Gateway will also manage the API request and send the request to the relevant
[Micro Services Architecture](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Micro_Services_Architecture.md) 
and will decouple from the client interface from the back-end implementation allowing for consistent communications, even as
internal services starts to be involved.
API Gateway will insure the request is sent to the correct [Micro Services Architecture](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Micro_Services_Architecture.md) 
and back to the client as efficiently as possible to help save time, resources to be more cost effective.
They are best suited for applications with multiple [Micro Services Architecture](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Micro_Services_Architecture.md)'s
and API will simplify the process 

** API Gateways are focused on API management focused on the back-end
