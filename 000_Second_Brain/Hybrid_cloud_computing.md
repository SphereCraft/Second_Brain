# Hybrid cloud computing

Hybrid cloud is best of both worlds.
Perfect for businesses that have a mix of IT environments and varying workload requirements.
Good for customisation. Businesses can tailor cloud environments to their specific needs.
Use **Public cloud** for less sensitive more dynamic workloads and **private cloud** for more critical sensitive operations
**Public Cloud** best for companies needing scalability without high investment in infrastructure
**Private Cloud** best for security and control over their IT environments
**Hybrid Cloud** best of both world and ability to move between both
