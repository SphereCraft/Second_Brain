# Root Tables

Root tables can be compared to street signs and traffic rules for the virtual land. Root tables will guide [[Data  packets]] within the [[VPC]] or help them leave the [[VPC]] to reach the internet or other destinations. Root tables consist of a sort of rules called roots which determine the direction of traffic. By default each [[Subnets]] in the [[VPC]] has its own root table, but can custom build your own, this can help with the security as can build your own set of root tables for each [[Subnets]] so it will only travel where you need it to.
