# Storage virtualisation

Combining the storage capacity from multiple physical storage devices. Ie HDD and SSD. Can have many separate storage devices that is then pooled into one single point to be then transferred to many different places, but all controlled from open single point. This will simplify management of storage. This is also cost effective
