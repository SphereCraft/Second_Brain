# Javascript

We will be using [[Typescript]]and JavaScript and [[AWS]] cloud development kit (AKA [[CDK]]) to automate things. This is designed to levitate our cloud development to the next level, bridging the gap between traditional and modern infrastructure.
[[Typescript]] is a turbo charger version of Javascript and is the chosen way for large scale cloud projects.
We will find JavaScript to be very powerful tool.
JavaScript is more known for web development, however it has expanded over time and is very useful for cloud development.
JavaScript file extension is .js
Unlike comments in [[Python]] (#), JavaScript comments start with // or for multi line comments they start with /* and end */.
JavaScript uses curly braces to define logic code, whereas [[Python]] uses indentation
JavaScript will often use : to indicate the end of the logic, but not always needed.
In JavaScript we use console.log which it like print in [[Python]]

// Function Syntax

function greet(name){
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
greet("Cloud Engineer");

To declare variables in JavaScript you would use 
**let** - this can be redefined  and it has block scope, meaning that it can only be accessed from within the block that its in. Very important in cloud development.
**var** - this was the old way to define variables
const - this version the variable cannot be changed.
