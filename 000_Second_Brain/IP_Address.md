# IP Address

**What is an IP address**
is a numerical address for each computer connected to the network. Internet protocol for communication. An IP address serves 2 main reasons
1. Host/network interface identification
2. Location addressing
Like a house address, an IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network. It ensure that data travelling across the internet reaches the correct destination.

 **Why are IP addresses important in Networking?**
They are the communication backbone and are fundamental to the operation of the internet and IP-based networks. And insure a connection and communication between devices. IP addresses are all about routing and delivery and they guide data packets along the right path from the sender to the receiver

**Types of IP addresses**
Ipv4 – 32-bit address space, 4.3 billion unique addresses. Eg 192.168.0.1
Ipv6 – 128-bit address space, 340 decillion unique address, in a hexadecimal format
The exhaustion of Ipv4 addresses has been a driving force behind the adoption of Ipv6
Ipv6 addresses the limitations of iPv4 and provides enhanced features like improved routing and security
**Static vs. Dynamic IP addresses**
Static IP addresses permanently assigned to a device providing a constant address for hosting servers, email systems and remote access. They are crucial for devices that require consistent predictable for external communications.
Dynamic IP addresses are temporarily assigned from a pool of available addresses by DHCP [[server]], commonly used for consumer devices, reducing the need for manual configuration and limited address space
**IP address configuration and management**
Assignment and configuration
DHCP
Manual configuration
Sub-netting and network segmentation
the purpose of sub-netting is to divide a larger network into smaller, manageable segments or sub-networks. This improves performance, simplifies management and security
Sub-networks are a key feature in AWS
Sub-net Mask is to divide the network and host a portion of an address, defining the network to which an IP address belongs.
Mastery of IP addressing is foundational and fundamental for cloud engineers, cloud architects, network engineers and security specialists.
