Continuous Integration - Continuous Delivery - Continuous Deployment

Automating and stream lining software delivery

What is CI/CD?
Its a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation in to the stages of app development. Successful CI/CD is making regular changes.
Continuous delivery ensures new changes are uploaded automatically to repositories for testing and collaborations, before going out to the customers.

*Benefits of CI/CD*

Faster time to market
Improved Quality and reliability
Increased developer production
Better collaboration
Reduced risk
Continuous feedback

*CI/CD Pipeline: A continuous flow*

Code - Build - Test - Deploy to staging - Acceptance testing - Production

Code - developers write code and share in a repository.
Build - Application is built/compiled from the latest code (version control)
Test - Automated testing to ensure code quality, if it passes it will move on, if not then back to developers.
Deploy to staging - App will be deployed to a testing environment
Acceptance Testing - More tests run in a production like environment
Production - If each stage has passed it will go live

Each stage will have checks in place to ensure quality.
