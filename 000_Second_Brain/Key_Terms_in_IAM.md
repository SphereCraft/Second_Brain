# Key Terms in IAM

[[IAM]] is like an employee working in a high rise building and their ID ([[IAM]]) gives them entry into the building, but only to a specific floor, depending on their level of clearance (what [[AWS]] services).
Groups are like different departments
[[IAM Roles]] are like temporary badges that gives permissions for a period of time.
IAM Policies gives the user the permissions to the resources needed and how they can interact with them.
Identity Federation allows users to use excising security credentials, such as corporate directories, so [[IAM]] isn't needed to use [[AWS]] services
