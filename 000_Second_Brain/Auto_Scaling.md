# Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling is a service provided by [[AWS]] to automatically adjust the number of compute instances in deployment based on real-time data. It can dynamically increase or decrease as needed automatically.
Auto Scaling can help with cost saving by only using whats needed when its needed, insuring you only pay for what you need/use.
Improved Fault tolerances will ensure your application will operate even if other instances fail maintaining a pre-defined number replacing unhealthy instances.
Seamless handling of varying load levels will auto scale with demand of traffic without and manual intervention.

Using auto scaling with [[Load Balancing]] will keep things running smoothly in both performance and availability.
