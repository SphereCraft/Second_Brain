# API - Application Programming Interface

API's are a means of communicating with servers

#### Example - restaurant

- API documentation - like the menu in a restaurant, It can list all the available requests, their parameters and responses you can expect.
- API - like the waiters, takes the user request to the [server](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Server.md) then returns
the response back to the user
- Making the API request - like ordering a meal, when a user makes a request they specify what data is needed and even how they want it processed
- Special request - like asking for no cheese or hot sauce, an API special request are make using query parameters, this can modify what data is 
processed and how it is returned
- [Server](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Server.md) - AKA the kitchen, the [server](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Server.md)
will process the API request and prepares the appropriate request
- API response - meal delivery, when the request is processed the [server](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Server.md) send 
the processed request back to the application.

#### Why are API's important?

- Efficiency - API allows for efficient communication between the different Software components without the user having to understand 
  how the [server](/home/jeff/Documents/Second_Brain/000_Second_Brain/Server.md) processes the request
- API's enable customising of data and service requested
- API's allow different services to be integrated to provide complex applications

API's can be use to leverage existing services to allow developers to concentrate on new, unique applications.
