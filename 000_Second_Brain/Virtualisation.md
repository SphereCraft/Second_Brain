[[Desktop virtualisation]]

**Benefits of virtualisation**

**cost efficiency**, reduces the need to invest in numerous physical machines , leading to cost saving in hardware and maintenance.
**Efficient resource utilisation**, maximises the use of computing resources leading to enhanced efficiency
**Scalability and flexibility,** Facilitates easy scaling of IT resources and quick deployment of new application
**Improved disaster recovery**, Simplifies backup and disaster recovery processes
**Isolation**, Ensures that problems in one virtual environment donâ€™t affect others
**The challenges of virtualisation**
**Security**, shared resources in a virtual environment may lead to security vulnerabilities
**Complexity in management**, Managing a virtualisation environment can be complex and required specialised skills
**Performance Overhead**, Performance overhead due to the additional layer between hardware and virtual machines
