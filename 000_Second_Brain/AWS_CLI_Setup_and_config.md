# AWS CLI Set up and config

# ðŸš€ Project - AWS CLI - S3 Bucket

##### [Week 2 - Git & Cloud Architecture](https://cloudengineeracademy.mykajabi.com/products/cloud-academy-tech-with-soleyman/categories/2154646443)

### Exercise 1: AWS CLI Setup and Configuration

****Objective:****Â Learn how to configure the AWS CLI.

1. Install the AWS CLI following the official AWS documentation.
    
2. Configure the AWS CLI with an IAM user credentials usingÂ `aws configure`. Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format.
    

### Exercise 2: Listing S3 Buckets

****Objective:****Â Practice listing Amazon S3 buckets using the CLI.

1. Use theÂ `aws s3 ls`Â command to list all the S3 buckets under your AWS account.
    
2. Identify how many buckets are currently created and document their names.
    

### Exercise 3: Creating an S3 Bucket

****Objective:****Â Learn to create an S3 bucket using the CLI.

1. Create a new S3 bucket usingÂ `aws s3 mb s3://<your-bucket-name>`, replacingÂ `<your-bucket-name>`Â with a unique name.
    
2. Verify the bucket was created successfully by listing all buckets.
    

### Exercise 4: Uploading a File to S3

****Objective:****Â Practice uploading a file to an S3 bucket.

1. Create a text file namedÂ `test.txt`Â and add some content to it.
    
2. Upload the file to your previously created S3 bucket usingÂ `aws s3 cp test.txt s3://<your-bucket-name>/`.
    
3. Verify the file was uploaded successfully by listing the contents of your bucket.
    

  
  

  
  

# ðŸš€ Project - AWS CLI - IAM User

##### [Week 2 - Git & Cloud Architecture](https://cloudengineeracademy.mykajabi.com/products/cloud-academy-tech-with-soleyman/categories/2154646443)

### Exercise: Creating an IAM User with the AWS CLI

****Objective:****Â Learn to create a new IAM user and attach a policy granting them specific permissions using the AWS CLI.

#### ****Part 1: Create a New IAM User****

1. ****Create the IAM user:****Â Use theÂ `aws iam create-user`Â command to create a new IAM user. ReplaceÂ `<UserName>`Â with the desired name for the new user.
    
    `aws iam create-user --user-name <UserName>`
    
2. ****Verify the user creation:****Â List all IAM users to ensure your new user was created successfully.
    
    `aws iam list-users`
    

#### ****Part 2: Attach a Policy to the New User****

To grant permissions to the user, you'll attach a policy. For this exercise, you'll attach theÂ `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`Â policy, allowing the user to list and read objects in S3 buckets.

1. ****Attach the policy:****Â Use theÂ `aws iam attach-user-policy`Â command to attach theÂ `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`Â policy to your newly created user. ReplaceÂ `<UserName>`Â with the name of the user you created.
    
    `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <UserName> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`
    
2. ****Verify the policy attachment:****Â Check the attached policies of the user to ensure theÂ `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`Â policy is attached.
    
    `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <UserName>`
    

#### ****Part 3: (Optional) Enable Programmatic Access****

If you want your IAM user to interact with AWS services through the AWS CLI or SDKs, you'll need to create access keys for programmatic access.

1. ****Create access keys:****Â Generate new access keys for the IAM user.
    
    `aws iam create-access-key --user-name <UserName>`
    
2. ****Store the access keys:****Â Make sure to securely store theÂ `AccessKeyId`Â andÂ `SecretAccessKey`Â returned by the command. These credentials are needed for the user to authenticate with AWS programmatically.
