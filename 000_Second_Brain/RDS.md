Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is an easy-to-manage relational database service optimised for total cost of ownership. It is simple to set up, operate, and scale with demand. Amazon RDS automates the undifferentiated database management tasks, such as provisioning, configuring, backups, and patching. Amazon RDS enables customers to create a new database in minutes, and offers flexibility to customised databases to meet their needs across 8 engines and 2 deployment options. Customers can optimise performance with features, like [Multi-AZ](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/) with two readable standbys, [Optimized Writes and Reads](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/#product-features#rds-features#customizable-performance), and [AWS Graviton3-based instances](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/), and choose from [multiple pricing options](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/) to effectively manage costs.
