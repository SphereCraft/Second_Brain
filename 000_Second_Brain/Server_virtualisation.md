# Server virtualisation

one large [[server]] split into many smaller servers that can all act independently of each other with special software just like having many computers.

**Hypervisor â€“** is used to split the physical [[server]] into many virtual servers all able to run its own operating system and applications, they share the resources of the physical [[server]] like the CPU, Memory and storage, but operate independently. Even though they share the same resources of the physical [[server]] they are not effected by each other.
