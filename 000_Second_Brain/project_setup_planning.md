# Phase 1: Project setup and planning

    1. Create new CDK Typescript project using 'cdk init --language typescript'
        command in the terminal

    2. Plan directories and create them all, or as much as you think.

    3. Map out the required permissions and group structures on paper first.

    4. Document any naming convention you'll follow
