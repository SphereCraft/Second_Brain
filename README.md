# My Obsidian Second Brain: A Cloud Engineering Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my Obsidian Second Brain, a digital repository built to support my learning in cloud engineering. This project was inspired by the Zettelkasten method, a note-taking and knowledge management system, which I’ve adapted to fit my unique learning process. While my approach doesn't strictly adhere to the traditional Zettelkasten method, the fragments I’ve adopted have made a huge impact on how I learn, retain, and apply knowledge.

## Why I Started This
When I began exploring cloud engineering, I quickly realized I needed a system to:
- Organize and make sense of the vast amount of information I was encountering.
- Encourage active learning by going beyond passive note-taking.
- Bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

That’s when I discovered Zettelkasten and its emphasis on atomic notes (small, self-contained ideas) and connections between concepts. By implementing my own version of the system, I found a way to streamline my learning journey.

## My Process
1. **Writing by Hand**:  
   I start with pen and paper. Writing by hand helps me process and internalize new concepts.

2. **Transcribing to Obsidian**:  
   I organize these handwritten notes into structured, linked entries in Obsidian. Each note represents a single idea, process, or question.

3. **Taking Action**:  
   I actively implement what I’ve learned—whether it’s creating a VPC, deploying EC2 instances, or automating infrastructure. This hands-on practice solidifies my understanding.

## Why It Works for Me
This process helps me:
- Break down complex topics into manageable pieces.
- Build meaningful connections between concepts.
- Transition from passive learning to active experimentation.

By combining writing, transcription, and practical application, I’ve found a method that not only works for me but also scales as my knowledge grows.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is a snapshot of my Second Brain, shared in the hope that it might inspire others. Here’s what you’ll find:
- **Notes**: Organized by topics related to cloud engineering, DevOps, and related fields.
- **Links**: Connections between notes to demonstrate relationships between concepts.
- **Actionable Insights**: Ideas and projects derived from the notes.

If you’re curious about implementing your own version of the Zettelkasten method or just looking for inspiration for your cloud engineering journey, feel free to explore, fork, or clone this repository.
